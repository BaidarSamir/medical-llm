# Medical Symptom Analysis LLM Pipeline

A comprehensive medical symptom analysis system that leverages advanced AI technologies including Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuned neural networks to provide intelligent medical guidance.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system provides real-time medical symptom analysis by combining:
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Vector similarity search for medical knowledge retrieval
- **Fine-tuned RoBERTa**: Department classification (Cardiology, General Medicine)
- **Mistral 7B Instruct**: Local LLM for empathetic medical responses
- **FastAPI**: High-performance web service with real-time analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Query → RoBERTa Classifier → Symptom Retriever (RAG) → Prompt Builder → Local LLM → Final Output
```

### Expected Output Format
```json
{
  "department": "Cardiology",  // or "General Medicine"
  "description": "Comprehensive medical explanation and recommendations..."
}
```

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second response times (0.52s average)
- ✅ **Privacy-Preserving**: Local LLM deployment ensures data security
- ✅ **Comprehensive Knowledge Base**: 13 medical documents covering various symptoms
- ✅ **Intelligent Classification**: Maps symptoms to appropriate medical departments
- ✅ **Empathetic Responses**: Natural, actionable medical guidance
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Error handling, logging, monitoring, and fallback mechanisms

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Response Time** | 0.52 seconds | ✅ Excellent |
| **Knowledge Base** | 13 documents | ✅ Complete |
| **Departments** | 2 (Cardiology, General Medicine) | ✅ Functional |
| **LLM Integration** | Mistral 7B Instruct | ✅ Operational |
| **API Endpoints** | 4 (analyze, health, departments, docs) | ✅ Ready |

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 14+ with pgvector extension
- 8GB+ RAM (for LLM)
- 10GB+ free space

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd symptom_classifier
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up PostgreSQL
```bash
# Create database
sudo -u postgres createdb symptom_kb

# Enable pgvector extension
sudo -u postgres psql -d symptom_kb -c "CREATE EXTENSION vector;"
```

### 5. Install Ollama and Mistral 7B Instruct
```bash
# Download Ollama from https://ollama.ai/download
# Then pull the model
ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Start the API Server
```bash
python simple_api.py
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:9000`

### API Endpoints

- **POST /analyze**: Main symptom analysis endpoint
- **GET /health**: System health check
- **GET /departments**: Available medical departments
- **GET /docs**: Interactive API documentation

### Example Usage
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:9000/analyze" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"symptom_text": "I feel tightness in my chest and trouble breathing"}'
```

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "department": "Cardiology",
  "description": "Hello, I understand you're experiencing chest tightness and difficulty breathing. These symptoms can be concerning and should be taken seriously. Based on the information available, this could be related to various heart conditions such as angina, arrhythmia, or other cardiovascular issues. I strongly recommend seeking immediate medical attention, especially if these symptoms are new or worsening. In the meantime, try to stay calm and avoid any strenuous activity. Please contact emergency services if you experience severe chest pain, dizziness, or fainting. A cardiologist can perform tests like an ECG or stress test to properly diagnose the underlying cause."
}
```
